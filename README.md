# Nextjs-Ecommerce
This is a demo project I created while coding along with a Udemy course. The ecommerce website is built with Nextjs and Tailwind CSS on the front-end, while API routes are handled using Nextjs and MongoDB as database. It has all the necessary features of modern e-commerce platforms such as authentication using NextAuth, state management using Redux, data persistence using cookies, shopping cart management, payment gateway implementation with Paywal, admin dashboard for product and user management, as well as complex search and filtering mechanisms. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
